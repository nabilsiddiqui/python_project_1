##### Code Details
*In the file calc.py, we implemented a basic calculator using python programming language ....... 
We asked the user to select the operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and the user could add, subtract, multiply or divide more than two numbers. We used if and elif statements to store the operations for each variable and print what the user has entered.
